        <h2>Moments with you</h2>
        <div class="timeline-container">
            <div class="event">
                <h3>Our First Meeting</h3>
                <p>It all started the moment I first noticed you during your introduction. I immediately felt a deep
                    sympathy for you,
                    knowing you had dreamed of becoming a doctor, but life had led you into CSE instead. Then, one day,
                    while talking to
                    Sharan about our classes, I caught you looking at me from across the room. I couldn’t bear the
                    intensity of your gaze
                    and knew it would be rude not to approach you. So, I decided to ask if you wanted to join the
                    classes with me.

                    I’ll forever be grateful to Jawanda Sir for allowing me to teach Sharan because, without her, we
                    might never have
                    crossed paths.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>C lab and classes</h3>
                <p>Fast forward to our classes, and I started flirting with you a little here and there—not with any
                    particular intentions,
                    but just to make you feel comfortable. To be honest, I wanted to test the waters and get a sense of
                    your vibe. The way
                    you texted was different from the other girls in our class, and I couldn't help but wonder if we had
                    finally met someone
                    who could keep up with our English terms and jokes.

                    Then, I saw you in the C programming lab, talking and sitting with Manthan, and for some
                    reason, something in
                    me just snapped. A wave of jealousy hit me, and without thinking, I walked over and sat between you
                    two. I started
                    talking to you again, just casually, but I couldn't help but focus on you more than usual. And then,
                    I looked into your
                    eyes... They were stunning. The way you listened so intently as I rambled on, the way you sat there,
                    fully
                    engaged—honestly, it was something else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>When I Knew It Was You</h3>
                <p>And then, one day in class, you finally said it. I had asked, "Do you have a boyfriend?" and you
                    replied, "Dude, je mera
                    hunda ta main tere naal ethe thodi gal krdi." I didn’t let it show, but inside, I was beyond happy.
                    And then, you
                    casually said, "I think I might be attracted to you," and that was it. You had me completely. I fell
                    even harder for you
                    in that moment.

                    After that, we exchanged IDs and started chatting more. Then, one evening, I called you at 8, right
                    after class, and we
                    talked... We talked about us.

                    A couple of days later, I asked you on the second and, well, we became official.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>Endless Conversations, Endless Love</h3>
                <p>Then we started talking for hours on end. We began chatting on Reddit, and I remember texting you in
                    the middle of the
                    night while I was on the train. Those late-night conversations became my favorite. And then, in
                    Faridabad, I found
                    myself waiting for your texts and calls, eagerly anticipating every message from you.

                    I remember the first calls we had—I talked about myself a lot at first, but then, on the evening of
                    August 3rd, I
                    finally got you to share more about yourself. It felt so special, hearing your thoughts and stories.

                    This continued for the whole week, talking on the phone after class, for hours, getting lost in each
                    other’s words. And
                    then we started FaceTiming, and it was the best thing in the world. Talking to you before bed became
                    my nightly ritual.
                    I’ll never forget the night we talked for 11 hours straight. Honestly, those days made me fall for
                    you even more.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>A Walk That Changed Everything</h3>
                <p>Then came the 19th. After our morning class, we had some free time before college started, and I
                    remember feeling like
                    everything was falling into place. We decided to go to Gurudwara Sahib, and just as we arrived, it
                    started to rain.
                    There we were, standing together before the glass gate, the world outside blurred by the rain, and
                    it felt like time had
                    slowed down just for us. The sound of raindrops hitting the ground, the cool breeze, and the warmth
                    of your presence
                    beside me—it was like nothing else mattered in that moment. We were side by side, talking quietly,
                    and I felt myself
                    falling for you even more with every passing second. There was something so peaceful, yet so
                    electric, about that
                    moment—like we were in our own little world.

                    Later that evening, I walked you home, and we took a stroll together. I can still remember the way
                    the streets felt, the
                    calmness of the air, and the closeness between us as we walked side by side. It wasn’t just a
                    walk—it was our first real
                    date, a quiet, intimate moment that felt like the start of something beautiful. We talked about
                    everything and nothing,
                    and it was in those simple, shared moments that I realized just how much I had grown to care for
                    you. That stroll is
                    still the best one I’ve ever taken, even after all these years. The memories of that day are etched
                    in my heart forever,
                    and I’ll always look back on it as the moment when everything truly began.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>The First Touch of Heaven</h3>
                <p>Then, I started my job at the new office, and you, as always, were incredibly supportive. Through
                    every long day and
                    late night, you were there, keeping me grounded. The FaceTimes and chats continued, and with every
                    conversation, whether
                    big or small, you made me fall for you even more—every single damn time.

                    But then, came that moment—the first time I held your hand. We were studying for our exams, and I
                    remember it so
                    clearly; it was before the yoga exam. There I was, sitting next to you, and without thinking, I
                    reached for your hand.
                    The moment our hands touched, it felt like the world stood still for just a heartbeat. It was like
                    heaven, a simple,
                    perfect connection. That feeling is still unmatched to this day, and I still cherish that moment as
                    much as I did when
                    it happened. It was in that quiet, tender moment that I realized how deeply I had already fallen for
                    you. Holding your
                    hand felt like everything had finally fallen into place.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>The First Peck: A Moment of Sweet Surrender</h3>
                <p>I remember those days in the IWT lab, where our little world unfolded amidst the chatter of our
                    batchmates. It was
                    during recess that we found our moments together, those precious seconds when we could connect, even
                    if the college
                    frowned upon our relationship. Those interactions became the heartbeats of our secret romance.

                    After the exams, we dove back into teaching our classmates the C language. While Himanshu led the
                    lesson, we’d sneakily
                    sit behind the rest of the class, our hands intertwined, hearts racing with excitement. I couldn’t
                    help but steal
                    glances at you, captivated by your presence. You were my muse, the one who filled my thoughts and
                    inspired me.

                    And then, there came that unforgettable day. We were sitting there, and you were gazing directly
                    into my eyes, your
                    warmth melting away the distance around us. In that moment, I felt an overwhelming urge to close the
                    space between us,
                    to lock my lips with yours and never let go. The world outside faded, and it was just you and me.

                    With everyone focused on the blackboard, I finally surrendered to the impulse that had been building
                    inside me. I leaned
                    in and gave you a gentle peck on the lips. It was a sweet, innocent kiss, yet it felt like fireworks
                    igniting within us.
                    Before that, I had only dared to kiss your forehead and cheek, but this little peck changed
                    everything.

                    You were just as thrilled as I was, your excitement radiating from you. I could see you couldn’t
                    contain it; you even
                    shared the news with your friend in a chat. That kiss marked the beginning of a new chapter in our
                    intimacy, a step
                    deeper into our beautiful journey together. It was a moment I’ll cherish forever, the day we crossed
                    a threshold and
                    embraced the connection that made us, us.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="event">
                <h3>The Secret Sanctuary: Our First Lip Kiss
                </h3>
                <p>As October rolled in, our classes resumed, and it felt like a ritual—counting down the minutes
                    until recess, when we
                    could escape to our little sanctuary in the IWT lab. It was our hideaway, a secret haven where we
                    could embrace and hold
                    hands, free from the watchful eyes of the world.

                    One day, I decided to take our escapade up a notch. I closed the door behind us, ensuring our little
                    bubble was sealed
                    tight. With a mischievous grin, I gently held your chin between my index finger and thumb, raising
                    your head to meet my
                    gaze. The tension in the air was electric, and I could feel my heart racing like I was about to take
                    a final exam I
                    hadn’t studied for!

                    In that moment, I pulled you closer, my heart pounding in anticipation. And then, without any more
                    hesitation, I locked
                    my lips with yours. It was our first official lip kiss! Now, I know what you're thinking: “Wait,
                    what? Our first kiss
                    was just a peck!” But let me tell you, this was different. This was the grand debut, the moment our
                    romance stepped out
                    of the shadows and into the spotlight.

                    Now, to be fair, I must admit you didn’t exactly join the kiss party. You didn’t push me away, but
                    let’s just say you
                    were more of an enthusiastic spectator! It was like I was the lead actor in a romantic comedy, and
                    you were sitting in
                    the front row, laughing and cheering me on. I could practically hear the applause in my head!

                    But let’s not underestimate the power of that kiss. It was a sweet mix of nervousness and
                    excitement, and even if you
                    didn’t dive in with both feet, it was enough to send my heart doing somersaults. We may have had an
                    audience outside,
                    but in that moment, it felt like we were the only two people in the world, breaking all the rules
                    and loving every
                    second of it. That kiss marked a spicy new chapter in our relationship, and I knew we were just
                    getting started!
                </p>

                <h3>The Handball Match: Kisses and Goals
                </h3>
                <p>So, let me take you back to October 28th—an epic day in our story. It all started a few weeks earlier
                    when you asked me
                    to attend your handball match. Like a total goof, I flat-out denied you. But I couldn’t let that be
                    the end of it. I had
                    to make it right, so I decided to volunteer for the handball match helpdesk. Ta-da! Wish granted!

                    The first girls' match went by in a flash as our team crushed it! But then came the second match,
                    and things got tense.
                    You guys were struggling to score, and time was slipping away. I could feel the pressure mounting,
                    and it was almost
                    unbearable. I knew how much you had prepared for this day, and the thought of you being sad if you
                    lost was enough to
                    send my heart into overdrive.

                    As halftime approached, with no goals in sight, I took a deep breath and started my first bani of
                    Chaupai Sahib. I
                    figured maybe a little divine intervention wouldn’t hurt, right? Just as I was gearing up for the
                    second bani, Davinder
                    scored a goal! Hope was back in the game! And then, just as my third bani was wrapping up, there you
                    came, swooping in
                    from the back like a superstar, scoring the winning goal!

                    Pandemonium erupted! Davinder netted another goal, and just like that, victory was ours!

                    After the match, we strolled out of college, and you needed to fill up your water bottle. That’s
                    when I decided to seize
                    the moment. All that pent-up stress and anxiety—poof! I wanted to relieve you of it, and before I
                    knew it, I leaned in
                    for my second lip kiss.

                    Now, here’s the kicker: you were holding the water bottle, and I was trying to keep my cool while
                    contemplating the
                    daring move of kissing you in a college corridor! Talk about risky business! But guess what? You
                    didn’t just stand there
                    this time. You actually joined in on the kiss!

                    That little twist made my heart leap! So, there we were, two daring souls stealing kisses in the
                    hallway, feeling like
                    we were on top of the world. As we walked out of college together, I couldn't help but think that
                    this day had turned
                    into one of the best memories I’ve ever had since August 19th. It was a perfect blend of
                    competition, camaraderie, and,
                    of course, kisses!</p>

                <h3>November: The Month That Tested Us
                </h3>
                <p>November arrived, and with it came a storm we hadn’t prepared for. Tensions began to rise as external
                    forces started
                    pulling us apart. Your parents and bua had taken a stand against our FaceTimes. Suddenly, those
                    late-night conversations
                    that felt like lifelines were gone. And as if that wasn’t enough, your phone broke, making even
                    chatting an uphill
                    battle.

                    The distance between us began to grow, and our talks became rarer with each passing day. But funny
                    thing—while the world
                    worked to push us apart, my love for you only grew stronger. Every fleeting message, every small
                    interaction, became a
                    moment I held onto tightly. I found myself waiting endlessly, holding onto the hope of even the
                    briefest conversation
                    with you.

                    This was also the time I realized something profound. No matter how rare our talks became or how far
                    apart we seemed,
                    you had an unshakable hold over me. It wasn’t just love—it was something deeper, something
                    unexplainable, like my heart
                    had handed you the keys and trusted you to keep them forever.

                    November might have been a month of distance, but it was also the month I truly understood what you
                    meant to me. You
                    weren’t just a part of my life—you had become my world...</p>

                <h3>December: The Month We Found Our Rhythm Again</h3>
                <p>After the storms of November, December brought a breath of fresh air, like the universe decided to
                    give us a break.
                    Things started looking up, and on the 3rd of December, we spent the whole damn day together in the
                    library. I swear, it
                    was the best day after the magic of the 19th and the thrill of the 28th.

                    I remember it so vividly—our little break in the park when you had macroni. We clicked our second
                    picture together, a
                    moment so simple yet etched in my heart like a masterpiece. The rest of the day, we were tucked away
                    in the library,
                    side by side, pretending to study but secretly savoring every second of each other's company. Before
                    heading home, we
                    even went to Happo Ma’am to get her recommendations for the exam the next day. It was a beautiful,
                    peaceful day, and for
                    once, the world felt perfectly aligned.

                    Then came the 5th—our first exam day. But let’s be honest, the real highlight wasn’t the exam; it
                    was the time we spent
                    before it. Sitting together in the library, holding hands, sharing those intimate moments that only
                    we could understand.
                    I couldn’t help but caress your lap, my thumb tracing little patterns on your hand. It was as if,
                    for those precious
                    hours, time stood still, and the rest of the world didn’t matter.

                    December wasn’t just a month; it was a chapter of reconnection, of small yet profound joys, and of
                    rediscovering the
                    magic we create whenever we’re together. ❤️.</p>

                <h3>December: The Bold Steps of Trust
                </h3>
                <p>December was a symphony of togetherness, each note more intimate than the last. On the 12th, just
                    like the 5th, we found
                    our sanctuary in the library. Holding hands, whispering little nothings, and sharing moments that
                    made life feel utterly
                    beautiful. We even arrived early that day—8:30 AM—despite our exam being scheduled at 1:30. But who
                    cared about time
                    when we were in our little bubble, untouched by the chaos of the outside world?

                    Then came the 17th, a day etched in my memory for the bold step I took. I’ll admit, my heart was
                    racing as I decided to
                    spice things up. While sitting there in the library, amidst the quiet hum of pages turning and pens
                    scratching, I let my
                    hand wander a bit further. When I touched your breasts, I saw the hesitation in your eyes, but what
                    struck me most was
                    that you didn’t stop me.

                    It wasn’t just about the moment itself—it was what it represented. That tiny, intimate act wasn’t
                    just physical; it was
                    a symbol of the trust we had built. The fact that you allowed me to be vulnerable with you, that you
                    trusted me enough
                    to let me explore that part of our relationship, meant more to me than words can convey.

                    It wasn’t just about attraction or desire; it was about connection, about knowing that in this vast
                    world, we had
                    something so intimate and profound that it could exist only between us. That moment was a quiet
                    whisper of love and
                    trust wrapped in the spice of our growing bond. It was a chapter I’ll treasure forever. ❤️

                <h3>7th January: A Bold New Chapter</h3>
                <p>December turned into a trying time for us. Your phone was broken yet again, and to make matters
                    worse, you were at your
                    bua’s, meaning even texting from your laptop was out of the question. It was a painful stretch of
                    silence, a void where
                    we couldn’t hear each other’s voices or share even the smallest of moments.

                    To add insult to injury, our next exams were postponed, leaving us with a dreaded 20-day gap where
                    we couldn’t see each
                    other. Those days felt eternal, like time itself had conspired to keep us apart. Yet somehow, we
                    made it through. We
                    held on, our bond stronger than the distance, enduring the ache of being apart.

                    It had been a while since we last met properly, and the anticipation of seeing you again had built
                    up so much inside me.
                    That day, like always, we came early to the college. Like always, we sat together, hands brushing,
                    our moments of stolen
                    intimacy making the library feel like our own little world.

                    But this time, I had something else in mind—a bold move I couldn’t resist anymore.

                    As we sat, my hand, familiar with yours, moved further. You looked at me with those eyes that always
                    held me captive. I
                    could tell you knew where I was headed, but you stayed silent—trusting me, as always. Slowly, I
                    reached down, my fingers
                    tracing a path that made your body respond in ways words never could.

                    Your expressions told me everything I needed to know—how much you wanted this, how much you trusted
                    me with every inch
                    of yourself. As my fingers explored your body, your breath hitched, and you clutched me, drawing me
                    closer. The way you
                    responded, the way your body trusted mine, was a moment I’ll never forget.

                    And when your hands found me, it was like you were letting me know—wordlessly, yet so
                    powerfully—that this was our
                    shared moment. Your touch sent shivers through me, making the connection between us even deeper.</p>

                <h3>8th January: Exploring New Heights of Intimacy
                </h3>
                <p>After the boldness of the previous day, I found myself craving more—not just physically but
                    emotionally, wanting to
                    explore the depths of our connection. When we met in the library, the air between us carried a
                    charge. You could feel it
                    too, couldn’t you? That spark of knowing that today would take us somewhere new.

                    We sat close, like always, but this time my hands found their way to you quicker than before. I
                    kissed you gently, but
                    with every kiss, my passion grew, and I could feel yours building too. My hands, now familiar with
                    the curves of your
                    body, slowly wandered down, teasing and caressing.

                    When I began to finger you, your body responded almost instantly. You didn’t say anything, but your
                    breathing quickened,
                    and I could feel how much you wanted this. You leaned into me, trusting me to guide the moment. The
                    way your body moved,
                    the soft sounds you made—it was intoxicating. I teased you, making sure every touch counted, and
                    your reactions only
                    pulled me deeper into the moment.

                    Then, you surprised me. You reached out, hesitating just slightly, and your hand found its way to
                    me. That simple act—it
                    wasn’t just physical—it was you telling me, without words, that you wanted to explore this just as
                    much as I did.

                    When you gave me your first-ever blowjob, I could see your nervousness at first. But as I guided
                    you, your lips—soft and
                    warm—began to explore me. You listened to me so well, following my instructions as I asked you to
                    use your tongue more,
                    and it drove me wild.
                    You were so good, so perfect, and I could tell that you wanted to make it special for me. And you
                    did.

                    But what stood out the most wasn’t just the physical act—it was the way you trusted me, the way you
                    gave yourself to me
                    so completely. I’ll never forget the way you looked at me afterward—shy but with a hint of pride, as
                    if you knew you’d
                    given me a memory I’d hold onto forever.

                    You know, even when I teased you a little, brushing my fingers against your most sensitive spots,
                    you let me, trusting
                    me to take care of you, to respect your limits while still exploring our intimacy.

                    That day wasn’t just about the physical connection—it was about how close we’d become, how much we
                    trusted each other to
                    share moments like this, to grow together.

                    You made me feel like the luckiest person in the world that day, and I hope you know how much it
                    meant to me—not just in
                    the moment, but even now, looking back.

                <h3>9th January: A New Challenge
                </h3>
                <p>The morning of 9th January brought a shift—a weight that neither of us was prepared for. My
                    conversation with Jawanda
                    Sir left me reeling. He didn’t explicitly mention us, but his words carried a warning, a subtle
                    nudge that the college
                    was beginning to notice the bond we shared.

                    It was clear: he didn’t want me interacting with you in the college anymore.

                    Hearing that was like a punch to the gut. How could I stay away from you? How could I ignore you
                    when every moment with
                    you felt so precious? But I also knew that this wasn’t just about us anymore. We had to tread
                    carefully, or we risked
                    making things even harder.

                    That day marked the beginning of a difficult phase for us. The playful interactions, the stolen
                    glances, and those
                    precious moments in the library—all of it now felt like it was slipping through our fingers. I could
                    feel the distance
                    creeping in, and it hurt.

                    I missed you, even when you were just a few feet away. The inability to hold your hand, to see your
                    smile without the
                    fear of being watched, made the days feel heavier. Every time I saw you in the corridors or during
                    class, all I wanted
                    to do was walk up to you, to talk to you like we used to. But I couldn’t.

                    And it wasn’t just about the college; it was about us. The restrictions made me realize just how
                    much you meant to me,
                    how much I relied on our connection to get through the day. Those days were some of the hardest, but
                    they also showed me
                    the depth of my love for you.

                    It was painful, yes, but even in that pain, I found myself holding on to the memories we’d made, the
                    hope that this
                    phase was just another test we’d get through together.

                    Even when we couldn’t talk or see each other the way we wanted to, I never stopped thinking about
                    you. You were, and
                    always will be, the center of my world.

                <h3>Growing Distance and Objections
                </h3>
                <p>As if the tension from college wasn’t enough, another storm began brewing at home. Your family
                    started raising
                    objections to our FaceTimes, which felt like another layer of separation being imposed on us.

                    The once warm, intimate conversations we shared began to dwindle. We were forced to rely on texting,
                    those short
                    exchanges that often lacked the warmth of our voices and the comfort of seeing each other’s
                    expressions. But even that
                    became a tightrope walk. Each chat felt risky, like we were navigating a minefield where one wrong
                    step could blow
                    everything up.

                    We had to delete our "sussy" messages, the playful banter that was just ours to share, as if it were
                    a secret we had to
                    hide from the world. To everyone else, we were "just friends," and maintaining that facade became a
                    challenge. Every
                    time I had to erase a sweet message from you or a moment of laughter we shared, it felt like losing
                    a piece of what made
                    our relationship special.

                    The distance now feels palpable, like a wall being built between us, brick by brick. I could sense
                    your frustration, too. The
                    limitations placed upon us were suffocating, and every day it felt like we were fighting against the
                    current.

                    But even in these dark moments, my love for you remained steadfast. I clung to the memories we had
                    created, the intimacy
                    we had shared. You were still the person who made my heart race, even if we couldn’t express it the
                    way we wanted.

                    Despite the obstacles, I hope that we can weather this storm together, knowing that our bond is
                    stronger than the
                    walls trying to keep us apart. Every message we exchanged, every stolen moment of connection, felt
                    like a victory
                    against the odds.

                    I know we would find a way to navigate this challenging phase, together, no matter how hard it got.

                    didn’t just light up my days; you became the sun around which my entire world revolved.

                    But, love, every fairytale has its challenges, doesn’t it? I still remember the days when we had to
                    tread carefully,
                    hiding our emotions from the prying eyes of the world. Pretending to be indifferent to you, when all
                    I wanted was to
                    shout my love from the rooftops, was like living with a piece of my soul missing. The fear of losing
                    you was like a
                    shadow that followed me everywhere, making me cling even more tightly to the moments we could call
                    ours.

                    You might not know this, but during those times of silence, when I couldn’t talk to you the way I
                    wanted, I replayed
                    every memory we had over and over again in my mind. Your laughter, your voice, the way your eyes
                    sparkled when you
                    smiled—it became my solace. The memories of you became the lifeline that pulled me through the
                    hardest days.

                    I won’t deny it, my love. I’m not perfect. I’m jealous, possessive, and hopelessly insecure when it
                    comes to you. The
                    mere thought of someone else getting even a sliver of your attention drives me mad. I can’t stand
                    the idea of anyone
                    else seeing that smile I love so much or hearing the sweetness in your voice. You are mine, and I’ll
                    never stop fighting
                    for every single part of you. Every time someone else is around you, I feel an ache in my chest that
                    only you can
                    soothe. It’s irrational, I know, but it’s because I love you so deeply that the thought of losing
                    you terrifies me to my
                    core.

                    What I wouldn’t give to have you here in my arms right now. To feel the warmth of your touch, to see
                    that beautiful face
                    up close, to whisper all the words I carry in my heart. Life without you feels incomplete, like a
                    puzzle with its most
                    important piece missing. You are my melody, my harmony, and the very rhythm of my life.

                    You are not just the love of my life—you are my sanctuary, my peace, and my home. You are my
                    partner, my best friend, my
                    greatest blessing. Every hardship we’ve faced together has only strengthened my love for you. With
                    every test, I’ve come
                    to understand just how much I need you and how much you mean to me. You are the light that guides me
                    through the
                    darkness, the reason I wake up with hope in my heart, and the reason I dream of a better tomorrow.

                    On this special day, your birthday, I want you to know that I am endlessly thankful for you. Thank
                    you for being the
                    incredible person you are. Thank you for choosing me, for loving me despite all my flaws and
                    insecurities. Thank you for
                    being my everything.

                    I promise you, my love, that I will always be here for you. I will cherish you, support you, and
                    love you
                    unconditionally for as long as I live. I will always be the one who:

                    Cares for you unconditionally, no matter the storms life throws at us.
                    Loves you unconditionally, without hesitation or doubt.
                    Guides you through every tough moment, standing steadfastly by your side.
                    Provides you a shoulder to lean on, a hand to hold, and a heart to find solace in.
                    Listens to you, no matter the time of day or night, without you ever worrying that you’re disturbing
                    me.
                    Reminds you every single day that you are my only one, the center of my universe, my reason for
                    living.
                    You are my forever, Ekampreet Kaur. My one and only. My queen. My everything. I am yours, yesterday,
                    today, tomorrow,
                    and for eternity.

                    Happy Birthday, my love.

                    With all my heart and soul,
                    Yours and only yours,
                    Ishpreet Singh

        <h2>Endless Love: My Heartfelt Promise to You</h2>
        <div class="notes-container">
            <>I find myself at a loss for words as I try to express just how much you mean to me, but I will try,
                because you deserve
                to know exactly what you are to me. You are my heart, my soul, the very reason I wake up every day with
                a smile on my
                face, knowing that I have someone as special as you by my side.

                From the very first moment I met you, my life began to change in ways I never imagined. I didn’t know
                that someone could
                have such a profound impact on my heart. But here we are, months into this beautiful journey, and I find
                myself falling
                deeper and deeper in love with you every single day. It’s not just about the laughs, the memories, the
                moments we
                share—it’s about the way you make me feel, the way you make everything around me seem brighter.

                When I think of you, I don’t just see the beautiful face that I adore; I see a person who has become my
                world, my
                everything. I see the girl who has captured my heart, my thoughts, and my every waking moment. I see
                someone who is so
                much more than just a person to me. You are my love, my muse, my reason for being. When you smile, it
                lights up my day.
                When you talk, it feels like time slows down, because every word you speak is precious to me.

                But it’s not just about the good times, Misty. It’s about every little thing that makes you you. It’s
                the way you care
                for those around you, even when you're hurting. It’s how you express your love, even when you feel
                vulnerable. I know
                you’ve been through a lot, and yet, you continue to show strength. And as I stand by you, I want you to
                know I am here
                for you, through everything, no matter how hard it gets. Your pain becomes my pain, your sadness my
                sadness—but your
                joy, your laughter, that’s what I live for.

                I know you’ve been going through some tough moments, and I want to say that I see you, and I hear you. I
                see your
                struggles, your insecurities, the weight you carry on your shoulders. And I want you to know that no
                matter how much you
                feel like you’re not enough, you are everything to me. You are more than I ever could have dreamed of.
                You are the love
                of my life, the one who fills my heart with happiness and peace.

                And yes, sometimes, I may be overwhelmed by my own emotions. I may get insecure or scared. I may worry
                about how I can
                be the best for you, because you mean so much to me. I know I’m not perfect, and I’m sure I’ve made
                mistakes along the
                way, but I will always learn from them, because the last thing I want to do is hurt you. You deserve all
                the love,
                happiness, and peace in the world, and I’ll do everything I can to be the person who can give that to
                you.

                I understand that sometimes you feel like you don’t deserve all of this love. That you’re not perfect.
                But listen to me,
                Misty, there is nothing in this world that could ever make me stop loving you. You’re not just beautiful
                on the outside,
                but your soul, your kindness, your heart, that’s what makes you perfect to me. And when you say you’re
                not special, it
                breaks me, because you are special—more than you could ever imagine. You are the one who makes my world
                whole, and
                without you, I would be lost.

                I want you to know that you are mine, and I am yours, and I will cherish you for all my life. Every
                moment spent with
                you is a gift, and I want to keep making memories with you that we can look back on and smile about for
                years to come.
                Even when we’re not together, you are always in my thoughts, in every little thing I do. I miss you more
                than words can
                say, and the thought of being without you is unbearable.

                I know sometimes, the weight of the world feels heavy on your shoulders, and I just want to be the one
                who takes that
                burden away. I want to be the person who supports you, who listens to you, who makes you feel safe and
                loved, no matter
                what. You don’t have to carry all of this alone. We are in this together, and I’ll always be here for
                you, no matter the
                circumstances.

                I may not always have the right words, but I want you to know that my love for you is endless, infinite.
                I’ll always
                choose you, through every doubt, every fear, every obstacle. I will stand by you, through the good and
                the bad, because
                you are the one I want to spend my life with. No matter what happens, nothing can change how I feel
                about you. You are
                my heart, my soul, my everything, and I’ll love you forever.

                Thank you for being you. Thank you for being mine. Thank you for making my life so incredibly beautiful.

                I love you, and I always will.
                As I sit here reflecting on our incredible journey together, I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with
                gratitude. Today is
                your birthday, and I want to celebrate you—every beautiful part of you. On this special day, I hope you
                feel cherished,
                adored, and loved beyond measure because you truly deserve it all. Thank you for being born into this
                world and for
                being the incredible person that you are.

                With each birthday that passes, I want to remind you just how extraordinary you are—not just today, but
                every single
                day. You are the spark that ignites my heart, the joy that fills my soul, and the love that completes my
                life. You bring
                warmth to my darkest days and light to my most shadowy moments. Your laughter is my favorite melody, and
                your smile is
                the sunrise that brightens my mornings. Thank you for every giggle, every whispered secret, and every
                moment of intimacy
                we share. They’re the treasures I hold close to my heart.

                I want you to know that I trust you completely. You are the one who has my heart and soul, and that
                trust is everything
                to me. But I also can’t ignore this intense feeling that sometimes creeps in—a need to keep you all to
                myself, to
                protect what we have so fiercely. Yes, I can be overly controlling and possessive at times, and I admit
                that I can get
                jealous, but it comes from a place of love. It’s because I fear losing you, and the thought of someone
                else taking your
                attention away from me sends my heart racing. I want you to know that my love for you is not just
                passionate; it’s
                protective. You are mine, and I will always want you close to me, safe and secure in my arms.

                Thank you for being so understanding of my flaws. You make me want to be a better person, and I promise
                to always work
                on myself to ensure that I’m the partner you deserve. Your patience, kindness, and unwavering support
                mean the world to
                me. I want you to feel cherished and adored every single day, and I will do everything in my power to
                remind you of your
                worth.

                On this birthday, I vow to make this year one filled with unforgettable memories, laughter, and
                adventures together. I
                want us to explore new horizons, to dive into new experiences, and to create stories we can share for a
                lifetime. Let’s
                find joy in the simplest of moments and make each day together an extraordinary gift.

                As we continue to navigate this journey of love, I promise to always be your biggest supporter, your
                confidant, and your
                shoulder to lean on. You are not alone in this; we are a team, and I will always be here to lift you up
                when you feel
                down and to celebrate with you during the happiest of times. You are the love of my life, and I will
                cherish you
                forever.

                Thank you for sharing your life with me. Thank you for trusting me with your heart and for allowing me
                to love you in
                all the ways that I do. Thank you for being the incredible person you are and for lighting up my world.
                As we celebrate your special day, I want to take a moment to reflect on all the beautiful memories we’ve
                created
                together. From our late-night conversations that stretch into the early hours, filled with laughter and
                the occasional
                whispered “I love you,” to those stolen glances across the classroom that make my heart skip a beat,
                every single moment
                with you is etched in my mind like a cherished photograph.

                I can’t help but smile when I think about our inside jokes—the silly moments that only we understand.
                Remember that time
                we tried to sneak snacks into the movie theater, only to get caught and end up laughing uncontrollably?
                Or the countless
                times we stayed up late, dreaming about our futures and sharing our wildest hopes? These memories remind
                me how
                perfectly we fit together, like pieces of a puzzle. Thank you for making even the simplest moments feel
                extraordinary.

                On your birthday, I wish for you all the happiness in the world. You deserve every beautiful thing that
                life has to
                offer, and I want to be the one to give you those experiences. I want to create a life filled with love,
                adventure, and
                unforgettable moments. Let’s promise each other that we will always support one another’s dreams, even
                when they seem
                far-fetched. I want to be the one cheering you on as you reach for the stars, because I know you have
                the potential to
                achieve greatness.

                And as we look ahead, I want to reassure you that no matter what challenges we face, my love for you
                will only grow
                stronger. I know that we have faced some tough times lately, with the distance and the constraints
                keeping us apart. But
                please remember, no obstacle is too great for us to overcome. We have something so special, so profound,
                that I truly
                believe we can conquer anything together.

                Your happiness is my priority, and I will always strive to make sure you feel loved and cherished, no
                matter the
                circumstances. So if you ever feel down, uncertain, or overwhelmed, please know that I’m just a
                heartbeat away. You can
                always come to me—whether you need to laugh, cry, or simply vent about the world. I’ll be here, ready to
                listen and
                support you in any way I can.

                As we celebrate you today, I also want to remind you that it’s okay to lean on me. It’s okay to share
                your fears and
                insecurities. We are in this together, and you don’t have to carry the weight of the world on your
                shoulders alone. I’m
                here to lighten the load and be your rock.

                So, here’s to you, Misty—on your birthday and every day after. Here’s to love that knows no bounds, to
                laughter that
                fills our hearts, and to a future that is as bright as your beautiful smile. Thank you for being the
                incredible person
                you are. You are everything I have ever wanted and more, and I will forever be grateful for the love we
                share.
                Thank you for being you, for embracing every part of yourself and sharing it with me. Your authenticity
                is a breath of
                fresh air in a world that often feels heavy and overwhelming. Thank you for your laughter, which has the
                power to lift
                my spirits no matter how tough my day has been. Your laughter is music to my ears, and it’s a sound I
                never want to be
                without.

                Thank you for your patience and understanding, especially during the times when my insecurities try to
                take over. Your
                ability to see beyond my flaws and love me for who I am is something I cherish deeply. Thank you for
                being my safe
                haven, where I can let my guard down and be vulnerable without fear of judgment.

                Thank you for your unwavering support, even when life gets tough. Knowing that you believe in me gives
                me the strength
                to push through any challenge. Thank you for your encouragement, for being my cheerleader when I need it
                most, and for
                reminding me of my worth when I doubt myself.

                Thank you for the little things—those sweet texts that brighten my day, the shared glances across a
                crowded room that
                say more than words ever could, and the way you hold my hand as if it’s the most precious thing in the
                world. Thank you
                for those quiet moments spent together, where silence speaks volumes and we don’t need to say anything
                at all.

                Thank you for your kindness, for showing me what it means to truly care for someone. Your heart is so
                big and so
                beautiful, and I’m honored to be a part of your life. Thank you for trusting me with your feelings, your
                dreams, and
                your fears. I promise to always honor that trust and to be the partner you deserve.

                Thank you for every smile you’ve shared with me, every secret you’ve entrusted me with, and every memory
                we’ve created
                together. Each one holds a special place in my heart, and I look forward to making countless more with
                you.

                Thank you for being my partner in crime, for embracing my quirks, and for joining me in our little
                adventures. Whether
                it’s a spontaneous outing or a cozy night in, you make every experience feel special.

                Thank you for being the love of my life, my confidant, my best friend. I am endlessly grateful for you,
                and I can’t wait
                to see what the future holds for us. On your birthday, I want you to know just how thankful I am for
                every moment we’ve
                shared and for every moment to come.

                Thank you for being my everything.
                I truly don’t know what I would do without you, and the thought of a life without your laughter, your
                warmth, and your
                love is simply unbearable. You are my anchor in this crazy world, the light that guides me through the
                darkness. You
                have a way of making the mundane feel extraordinary, and every day with you is a new adventure waiting
                to unfold.
                Without you, I would be lost, wandering aimlessly without purpose or joy.

                You are my dream come true, the missing piece I never knew I was searching for. Each moment we share
                reminds me just how
                lucky I am to have you in my life. So as we celebrate you today, I want to hold onto the promise of our
                love and the
                countless memories yet to be made. I envision us growing together, creating a beautiful story filled
                with laughter, joy,
                and love that knows no bounds.

                Here’s to you, my love, the one who makes my heart race and my soul sing. I look forward to every
                moment, every smile,
                and every adventure that awaits us. As we close this chapter and turn the page to a new year together,
                know that my love
                for you will only continue to grow, deepening with every breath we take side by side.

                So let’s embrace this journey together, hand in hand, heart to heart, knowing that our love is the
                greatest story ever
                told, and I am eternally grateful to share it with you. Here’s to us, to our love, and to a future that
                is as bright and
                beautiful as you are.

                Forever yours,
                Ishpreet Singh
