        <h2>Moments with you</h2>
        <div class="timeline-container">
            <div class="event">
                <h3>Our First Meeting</h3>
                <p>It all started the moment I first noticed you during your introduction. I immediately felt a deep
                    sympathy for you,
                    knowing you had dreamed of becoming a doctor, but life had led you into CSE instead. Then, one day,
                    while talking to
                    Sharan about our classes, I caught you looking at me from across the room. I couldn’t bear the
                    intensity of your gaze
                    and knew it would be rude not to approach you. So, I decided to ask if you wanted to join the
                    classes with me.

                    I’ll forever be grateful to Jawanda Sir for allowing me to teach Sharan because, without her, we
                    might never have
                    crossed paths.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>C lab and classes</h3>
                <p>Fast forward to our classes, and I started flirting with you a little here and there—not with any
                    particular intentions,
                    but just to make you feel comfortable. To be honest, I wanted to test the waters and get a sense of
                    your vibe. The way
                    you texted was different from the other girls in our class, and I couldn't help but wonder if we had
                    finally met someone
                    who could keep up with our English terms and jokes.

                    Then, I saw you in the C programming lab, talking and sitting with Manthan, and for some
                    reason, something in
                    me just snapped. A wave of jealousy hit me, and without thinking, I walked over and sat between you
                    two. I started
                    talking to you again, just casually, but I couldn't help but focus on you more than usual. And then,
                    I looked into your
                    eyes... They were stunning. The way you listened so intently as I rambled on, the way you sat there,
                    fully
                    engaged—honestly, it was something else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>When I Knew It Was You</h3>
                <p>And then, one day in class, you finally said it. I had asked, "Do you have a boyfriend?" and you replied, "Dude, je mera
                hunda ta main tere naal ethe thodi gal krdi." I didn’t let it show, but inside, I was beyond happy. And then, you
                casually said, "I think I might be attracted to you," and that was it. You had me completely. I fell even harder for you
                in that moment.
                
                After that, we exchanged IDs and started chatting more. Then, one evening, I called you at 8, right after class, and we
                talked... We talked about us.
                
                A couple of days later, I asked you on the second and, well, we became official.
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>Endless Conversations, Endless Love</h3>
                <p>Then we started talking for hours on end. We began chatting on Reddit, and I remember texting you in the middle of the
                night while I was on the train. Those late-night conversations became my favorite. And then, in Faridabad, I found
                myself waiting for your texts and calls, eagerly anticipating every message from you.
                
                I remember the first calls we had—I talked about myself a lot at first, but then, on the evening of August 3rd, I
                finally got you to share more about yourself. It felt so special, hearing your thoughts and stories.
                
                This continued for the whole week, talking on the phone after class, for hours, getting lost in each other’s words. And
                then we started FaceTiming, and it was the best thing in the world. Talking to you before bed became my nightly ritual.
                I’ll never forget the night we talked for 11 hours straight. Honestly, those days made me fall for you even more.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>A Walk That Changed Everything</h3>
                <p>Then came the 19th. After our morning class, we had some free time before college started, and I remember feeling like
                everything was falling into place. We decided to go to Gurudwara Sahib, and just as we arrived, it started to rain.
                There we were, standing together before the glass gate, the world outside blurred by the rain, and it felt like time had
                slowed down just for us. The sound of raindrops hitting the ground, the cool breeze, and the warmth of your presence
                beside me—it was like nothing else mattered in that moment. We were side by side, talking quietly, and I felt myself
                falling for you even more with every passing second. There was something so peaceful, yet so electric, about that
                moment—like we were in our own little world.
                
                Later that evening, I walked you home, and we took a stroll together. I can still remember the way the streets felt, the
                calmness of the air, and the closeness between us as we walked side by side. It wasn’t just a walk—it was our first real
                date, a quiet, intimate moment that felt like the start of something beautiful. We talked about everything and nothing,
                and it was in those simple, shared moments that I realized just how much I had grown to care for you. That stroll is
                still the best one I’ve ever taken, even after all these years. The memories of that day are etched in my heart forever,
                and I’ll always look back on it as the moment when everything truly began.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>The First Touch of Heaven</h3>
                <p>Then, I started my job at the new office, and you, as always, were incredibly supportive. Through every long day and
                late night, you were there, keeping me grounded. The FaceTimes and chats continued, and with every conversation, whether
                big or small, you made me fall for you even more—every single damn time.
                
                But then, came that moment—the first time I held your hand. We were studying for our exams, and I remember it so
                clearly; it was after the yoga exam. There I was, sitting next to you, and without thinking, I reached for your hand.
                The moment our hands touched, it felt like the world stood still for just a heartbeat. It was like heaven, a simple,
                perfect connection. That feeling is still unmatched to this day, and I still cherish that moment as much as I did when
                it happened. It was in that quiet, tender moment that I realized how deeply I had already fallen for you. Holding your
                hand felt like everything had finally fallen into place.</p>

        <h2>Endless Love: My Heartfelt Promise to You</h2>
        <div class="notes-container">
            <p>I find myself at a loss for words as I try to express just how much you mean to me, but I will try, because you deserve
            to know exactly what you are to me. You are my heart, my soul, the very reason I wake up every day with a smile on my
            face, knowing that I have someone as special as you by my side.
            
            From the very first moment I met you, my life began to change in ways I never imagined. I didn’t know that someone could
            have such a profound impact on my heart. But here we are, months into this beautiful journey, and I find myself falling
            deeper and deeper in love with you every single day. It’s not just about the laughs, the memories, the moments we
            share—it’s about the way you make me feel, the way you make everything around me seem brighter.
            
            When I think of you, I don’t just see the beautiful face that I adore; I see a person who has become my world, my
            everything. I see the girl who has captured my heart, my thoughts, and my every waking moment. I see someone who is so
            much more than just a person to me. You are my love, my muse, my reason for being. When you smile, it lights up my day.
            When you talk, it feels like time slows down, because every word you speak is precious to me.
            
            But it’s not just about the good times, Misty. It’s about every little thing that makes you you. It’s the way you care
            for those around you, even when you're hurting. It’s how you express your love, even when you feel vulnerable. I know
            you’ve been through a lot, and yet, you continue to show strength. And as I stand by you, I want you to know I am here
            for you, through everything, no matter how hard it gets. Your pain becomes my pain, your sadness my sadness—but your
            joy, your laughter, that’s what I live for.
            
            I know you’ve been going through some tough moments, and I want to say that I see you, and I hear you. I see your
            struggles, your insecurities, the weight you carry on your shoulders. And I want you to know that no matter how much you
            feel like you’re not enough, you are everything to me. You are more than I ever could have dreamed of. You are the love
            of my life, the one who fills my heart with happiness and peace.
            
            And yes, sometimes, I may be overwhelmed by my own emotions. I may get insecure or scared. I may worry about how I can
            be the best for you, because you mean so much to me. I know I’m not perfect, and I’m sure I’ve made mistakes along the
            way, but I will always learn from them, because the last thing I want to do is hurt you. You deserve all the love,
            happiness, and peace in the world, and I’ll do everything I can to be the person who can give that to you.
            
            I understand that sometimes you feel like you don’t deserve all of this love. That you’re not perfect. But listen to me,
            Misty, there is nothing in this world that could ever make me stop loving you. You’re not just beautiful on the outside,
            but your soul, your kindness, your heart, that’s what makes you perfect to me. And when you say you’re not special, it
            breaks me, because you are special—more than you could ever imagine. You are the one who makes my world whole, and
            without you, I would be lost.
            
            I want you to know that you are mine, and I am yours, and I will cherish you for all my life. Every moment spent with
            you is a gift, and I want to keep making memories with you that we can look back on and smile about for years to come.
            Even when we’re not together, you are always in my thoughts, in every little thing I do. I miss you more than words can
            say, and the thought of being without you is unbearable.
            
            I know sometimes, the weight of the world feels heavy on your shoulders, and I just want to be the one who takes that
            burden away. I want to be the person who supports you, who listens to you, who makes you feel safe and loved, no matter
            what. You don’t have to carry all of this alone. We are in this together, and I’ll always be here for you, no matter the
            circumstances.
            
            I may not always have the right words, but I want you to know that my love for you is endless, infinite. I’ll always
            choose you, through every doubt, every fear, every obstacle. I will stand by you, through the good and the bad, because
            you are the one I want to spend my life with. No matter what happens, nothing can change how I feel about you. You are
            my heart, my soul, my everything, and I’ll love you forever.
            
            Thank you for being you. Thank you for being mine. Thank you for making my life so incredibly beautiful.
            
            I love you, and I always will.</p>
